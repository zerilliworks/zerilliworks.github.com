    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Or: Why You Should NEVER Make Robots Fake Sincerity</h3>

<p>While helping a friend construct a website, I signed up for Weebly. I didn't even have a website, I was just a collaborator. I didn't want anything to do with Weebly. For some reason, she began getting uncomfortably clingy. Look at this as an example of how to creep out your customers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'll be clear now that I do not like drag-and-drop site builders. Only one such service have I ever described in terms that may be optimistically construed as "fond" -- that service being Squarespace. And that's only because they opened up their internals to developers.</p>

<p>So have a look at this.</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/Weebly-Believing.png" title="Don't stop believin' (in your website)" ></p>

<p><a href="/downloads/weebly-believing.txt/">If you can't see the image, click here for the text version.</a></p>

<p>The time since I signed up is probably the second worst thing about this. It's just odd. It reminds me that there is some task somewhere (clearly not a human) that is looking over less-than-frequently-active accounts and telling them to get going. It's unbelievably insincere, and it's frankly a little condescending. How so?</p>

<blockquote><p>Maybe you got busy and forgot about your website. We understand. When you signed up you probably had a vision for your site. We want to help you make that a reality. We promise that Weebly truly is the easiest way to create a website.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course I had a vision. Perhaps I own a business, I sell goods, I'm an artist, I'm a traveller, I'm a game show contestant with a penchant for blogging. What's gonna matter is my content. If I'm passionate enough, I'll find the best way to present it. I am disinclined to believe that anyone who has any real desire to run a website would forget about it for 29 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes and 47 seconds.</p>

<p>This helpful message is a little too chummy. It is certainly not sincerely endorsed by the Weebly Team, it was sent by a robot that's been told how to sound friendly. A person wrote generic text without much thought and I was on the receiving end of a template engine fed with those words. Nothing really makes me feel less cared for than robots acting like people. Giving them a little personality can be okay, but this is kind of insulting. Is your team actually nervous that I might not realize the full potential of my business? That's something investors worry about. And something robots think nothing of.</p>

<p>Then this happens:</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/Weebly-Sniffle.png" title="Sniffle. Sniffle..." ></p>

<p><a href="/downloads/weebly-sniffle.txt/">If you can't see the image, click here for the text version.</a></p>

<p>The subject of this message was literally "That's sad." No, this email is the sad thing. You trained machines to sound sympathetic, and it's just unsettling to make them cry. <em>For the love of God, knock it off.</em> There's nothing wrong with the concept of automated messages. But <em>please</em> do not make them f--king cry. That does not make me feel cared for. Your team doesn't seem to be there for me, it seems like you need to clutch your flaky customers in a death grip.</p>

<p>Don't fret though, you fantastically sincere liars, I think this email could be fixed pretty easily.</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/Weebly-Sniffle-fixed.png" title="Just take a Sharpie to it." ></p>

<p>There. That's basically free advice, Weebly. If your team is feeling sincere and nervous and sympathetic, my typical consulting fee is $17,000.</p>

<p>For the record, one of their founders eventually sent me a personal email asking for feedback. Way to go, fellas. That's where you lay on the charm, in the actual exchanges between actual people. That redeemed their support team a bit. That was someone who was really wondering what went wrong and wanted to find a solution. I'm not being sarcastic there, if you're looking to connect with a customer, a real live human being is the way to do it. I absolutely love that.</p>

<p>Sending automated emails that cry is tantamount to deception. That's what I have to say to them.</p>

<p>I can't be the only person that feels this way. I very highly value genuine interactions, and pretty much any attempt to imbue emotion without real effort is simply insulting to me.</p>

<p>Seriously, without the mendacious nervousness and sniffles, these would be just helpful emails. I might have read them without rolling my eyes.</p>

<p>If you're someone who also dislikes this sort of indiscretion, I'd appreciate a comment so I know I'm not alone.</p>

<p>Also, if you happen to be an English professor and would like to tell me whether I should have used <em>whom</em> in that last sentence, I would appreciate it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I could have just tossed a WordPress installation up somewhere. It probably would have taken less time
to set up. But I'm not a big fan of WordPress. I'm not a big fan of anything that needs extra plugins to
be reasonably secure. I like fast and simple. AND NOW HERE I AM.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Any seasoned (or even soft-boiled) developer realizes the potential of the terminal. I'm not an average
web user. I shouldn't have to learn the lingo of the CMS du-jour. if I want to build a good site or blog. I
should be able to use basically three skills: Git, Markdown, and the terminal. No dicking through page
after page of backend material. I already know these things, and they have proven themselves as my most
enjoyable tools to use.</p>

<p>I also wanted this blog to be fast. Software like WordPress, Movable Type, MojoMotor, Drupal... They're
burdened with significant overhead of processing and delivering pages. Some have plugins to help, but
I think that we shouldn't even need them. Why would you ship a slow product and have third parties make
it safe and efficient? Seems like skipping a step.&dagger;</p>

<p>I don't want to pick on WordPress too much. Automattic is a neat company and deserves respect for making
blogging and site creation so accessible. For me, it became less efficient once I "knew better."</p>

<p>So here I am working with Octopress. I get to tap out Markdown without needing a web-based WYSIWYG editor
and type a command to send everything up to the free Github Pages service. This blog is what I'd call
"TV Magic." Like on cooking shows. All of the same things happen here that would happen on a dynamic
site, just done beforehand so they come out quick. Similar to the ways Emeril Lagasse has his roasts
roasting an hour before the show. Just when they're ready, it's <em>Bam</em> and we have dinner.</p>

<p>Octopress is wonderful software, and definite props to Brandon Mathis for his work making Jekyll friendly.
Good sir, you're the only reason I actually had enough fun putting up a blog to... Well, put up a blog.</p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress - A blogging framework for hackers</a></p>

<p>At the end of the day, roasting my roasts in advance means low overhead, faster requests, and simple
hosting. I'm a PHP programmer for sure, and I know there are things PHP and its derivative frameworks
are good at.</p>

<p>Simple blogging just isn't putting PHP's best foot forward.</p>

<p>&dagger; <em>Yeah, ORACLE.</em></p>
