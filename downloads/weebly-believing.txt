Don't stop believin' (in your website)

Hi Armand,
We noticed that it's been 29 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes and 47 seconds since you signed up at Weebly and you still haven't published your website yet.
And...well, we're starting to get a little nervous. We just don't want you to become another unpublished statistic--a website that could have been.
Maybe you got busy and forgot about your website. We understand. When you signed up you probably had a vision for your site. We want to help you make that a reality. We promise that Weebly truly is the easiest way to create a website.
So, we just wanted to give you a little nudge to get you back into action and remind you that we're here to help.
Two steps to get your site going again:

We believe in you!

Sincerely,
The Weebly Team
