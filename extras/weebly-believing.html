<p>Don&#8217;t stop believin&#8217; (in your website)</p>

<p>Hi Armand,
We noticed that it&#8217;s been 29 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes and 47 seconds since you signed up at Weebly and you still haven&#8217;t published your website yet.
And&#8230;well, we&#8217;re starting to get a little nervous. We just don&#8217;t want you to become another unpublished statistic&#8211;a website that could have been.
Maybe you got busy and forgot about your website. We understand. When you signed up you probably had a vision for your site. We want to help you make that a reality. We promise that Weebly truly is the easiest way to create a website.
So, we just wanted to give you a little nudge to get you back into action and remind you that we&#8217;re here to help.
Two steps to get your site going again:
